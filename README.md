### Additional Development Tips

- **Wolfram Alpha API Integration**: To extend the capabilities of the app, consider integrating the Wolfram Alpha API for computational intelligence and data interpretation. This could be particularly useful in the cloud API tab for complex calculations or data analysis tasks.
  - You can use the API to fetch computational results for user queries directly within the app, providing a powerful tool for research and learning.

```javascript
// Example function to fetch data from Wolfram Alpha API
function fetchWolframAlpha(query) {
    const apiKey = 'YOUR_WOLFRAM_ALPHA_API_KEY';
    fetch(`https://api.wolframalpha.com/v2/query?input=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&format=plaintext&output=JSON&appid=${apiKey}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
}
```
