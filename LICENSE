**The "Not Too Big to Share" License (NTBSL) Version 1.0**

**Preamble:**
This license governs the use of the software and its accompanying documentation (hereinafter referred to as "the Software"). If you plan on making big bucks or expanding your empire, read on; but until then, enjoy the free ride with a dash of humor.

**1. Definitions:**
- **"Software"** refers to the code, binaries, associated media, data, and documentation, whether in electronic or printed format.
- **"You"** or **"Your"** refers to the individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

**2. Grant of Rights:**
- You are hereby granted a license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:
  
**3. Conditions:**
- **Revenue Cap:** This license is valid until You generate revenue exceeding $10,000 USD from the Software or any derivative works.
- **Team Size:** This license remains in effect until Your team expands to more than five (5) employees.
- **Humor Clause:** You agree not to remove any humorous comments, jokes, or witty lines found within the code. If you add your own, more power to you!

**4. Termination:**
- Should You exceed the Revenue Cap or Team Size, this license will self-destruct (metaphorically speaking). You will then need to contact the Licensor to negotiate commercial licensing terms suitable for your new, swanky status.

**5. Redistribution:**
- You may distribute verbatim copies of the Software as long as you do not misrepresent the origin of the Software and you include this License with every copy. Selling the Software for more than your annual gym membership costs (let's keep it reasonable) is frowned upon without invoking commercial terms.

**6. Modifications:**
- Modifications to the Software are allowed, encouraged, and celebrated with virtual high-fives. However, modified versions must carry noticeable mentions of the modifications, ideally with before-and-after photos for dramatic impact.

**7. Disclaimer of Warranty:**
- The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. If it breaks your device, makes your coffee taste bitter, or unfriends you on social networks, don't look at us.

**8. Limitation of Liability:**
- In no event shall the Authors or Copyright Holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.

**9. Boasting Rights:**
- Should your use of the Software lead to epic success, the creators humbly request a shout-out, a thank you note, or at least a tweet. Use hashtag #NTBSLWin.

**End of License**
